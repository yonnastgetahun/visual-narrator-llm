# TRAINING ISSUE ANALYSIS & SOLUTION

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Phase 2 Training Failure

### Symptoms:
- ❌ Loss: 0.0 throughout training
- ❌ Training time: 2h48m (expected: 5-10min)
- ❌ Model output: "Describe this image: a cat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
- ✅ Phase 1 model still works perfectly

### Root Cause:
Data preparation bug in `scale_up_phase.py` prevented gradient flow

### Evidence:
- Phase 1 model: "a cat with a cat face on a white background" ✅
- Phase 2 model: "a cat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" ❌

### Solution:
Using `scale_up_phase_fixed.py` with proper data preparation

### Expected Fix:
- Loss should start at ~4-6 and decrease
- Training should take 5-15 minutes
- Model should generate coherent descriptions

## STATUS: Running fixed training script...
