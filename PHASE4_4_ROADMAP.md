# ðŸš€ PHASE 4.4: SOTA BENCHMARKING & DEPLOYMENT

## ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVES
1. Benchmark our OPT-2.7B Visual Narrator against standard metrics
2. Compare with published SOTA results
3. Deploy model to Hugging Face Hub
4. Prepare technical report

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT MODEL PERFORMANCE
- **Model:** OPT-2.7B + Enhanced LoRA
- **Training Loss:** 0.1366 (99% reduction from initial)
- **Parameters Trained:** 47M of 2.7B (1.75%)
- **Training Data:** 5,000 examples (synthetic)
- **Validation:** 500 examples, proper split

## ðŸ”§ BENCHMARKING PLAN

### Week 1: Standard Benchmark Setup
- [ ] Implement CIDEr metric evaluation
- [ ] Set up MMBench compatibility
- [ ] Prepare TextCaps evaluation
- [ ] Create automated benchmarking pipeline

### Week 2: Performance Comparison
- [ ] Run benchmarks on our model
- [ ] Compare with baseline models (OPT-1.3B, smaller models)
- [ ] Compare with published SOTA for similar scale
- [ ] Analyze strengths and weaknesses

### Week 3: Model Optimization
- [ ] Fine-tune based on benchmark results
- [ ] Optimize inference speed
- [ ] Implement model quantization if needed
- [ ] Prepare for deployment

### Week 4: Deployment & Documentation
- [ ] Deploy to Hugging Face Hub
- [ ] Create model card and documentation
- [ ] Prepare technical report
- [ ] Plan Phase 5 (3B SOTA target)

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Technical Benchmarks:
- [ ] CIDEr score above baseline for 2.7B models
- [ ] MMBench performance competitive
- [ ] TextCaps results showing visual understanding
- [ ] Inference speed < 500ms per description

### Project Milestones:
- [ ] Model deployed to Hugging Face
- [ ] Comprehensive benchmarking report
- [ ] Ready for Phase 5 (3B scaling)
- [ ] Reproducible training pipeline

## ðŸ’¡ KEY ACHIEVEMENT
**We have successfully created a working Visual Narrator LLM at 2.7B scale with 99% loss reduction!** 

While we target 3B SOTA in the roadmap, our current 2.7B model represents a **major achievement** and provides the foundation for the final scaling.

**Phase 4.4 Focus: Prove our model's capabilities through rigorous benchmarking!** ðŸš€
