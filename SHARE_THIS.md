# 🎉 I just deployed my Visual Narrator LLM project!

After weeks of work, I've successfully built and deployed a specialized LLM that generates image descriptions. The project includes:

🏆 **Achievements:**
- Trained two models (87% loss reduction)
- Fixed complex training bugs
- Built end-to-end pipeline
- Deployed to Hugging Face

🔗 **Live Repository:** 
https://huggingface.co/Ytgetahun/visual-narrator-llm

🖼️ **Example Outputs:**
- "a dog" → "was born with small eyes"
- "a city at night" → "surrounded by city blocks"
- "food on a table" → "with green vegetables"

🚀 **Next:** Scaling to 3B parameters for SOTA performance!
