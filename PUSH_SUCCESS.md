- **Phase 2:** 87% loss reduction (8.14 → 1.09)
- **Training Time:** 3-5 minutes per model
- **Model Quality:** Coherent, creative descriptions

## 🎯 HOW TO USE YOUR MODELS

### Quick Start:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load your deployed model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Ytgetahun/visual-narrator-llm")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Ytgetahun/visual-narrator-llm")

# Generate descriptions
prompt = "Describe this image: a beautiful sunset"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
description = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
# Phase 2 model (recommended)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./outputs/phase2_fixed")

# Phase 1 model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./outputs/first_run")
