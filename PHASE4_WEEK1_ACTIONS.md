# ðŸ“… PHASE 4.1 - WEEK 1 ACTION PLAN
## 3B Model Foundation & Memory Optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ WEEK 1 GOALS

### Day 1-2: 3B Model Testing
- [ ] Test loading Llama 3-3B on A100
- [ ] Test loading Qwen 2.5-3B on A100  
- [ ] Measure GPU memory usage for each
- [ ] Identify most compatible 3B model

### Day 3-4: Memory Optimization
- [ ] Implement LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- [ ] Test training with LoRA on 774M model
- [ ] Measure memory savings and performance
- [ ] Optimize LoRA parameters for 3B scale

### Day 5-7: Baseline Establishment
- [ ] Run baseline training on selected 3B model
- [ ] Establish performance metrics
- [ ] Begin LVD-2M dataset download
- [ ] Create Phase 4.1 progress report

## ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE COMMANDS (On Lambda)

### 1. Test 3B Model Loading:
