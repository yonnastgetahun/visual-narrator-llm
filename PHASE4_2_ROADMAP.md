# ðŸš€ PHASE 4.2: PROFESSIONAL DATASET INTEGRATION

## ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVES
1. Integrate high-quality training datasets
2. Create scalable data pipeline
3. Combine with LoRA-optimized 2.7B model
4. Establish professional training workflow

## ðŸ“Š DATASET STRATEGY

### Immediate (This Week):
- **COCO-Caption** - 100K+ high-quality image captions
- **LLaVA-Video-178K** - Video descriptions for temporal learning
- **Synthetic data** - Continue as fallback

### Research (Parallel):
- **LVD-2M** - Continue download research
- **YouDescribe** - Audio descriptions research  
- **WebVid** - 10M video-text pairs research

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL PLAN

### Week 1: Data Pipeline
- [ ] Integrate COCO-Caption with LoRA training
- [ ] Create data preprocessing and validation
- [ ] Test full training pipeline
- [ ] Establish baseline performance

### Week 2: Scaling & Optimization
- [ ] Scale to larger dataset subsets
- [ ] Optimize data loading for A100
- [ ] Implement data augmentation
- [ ] Add multi-dataset training

### Week 3: Advanced Integration
- [ ] Integrate video description datasets
- [ ] Implement curriculum learning
- [ ] Add professional evaluation metrics
- [ ] Prepare for Phase 4.3 (SOTA benchmarking)

## ðŸš€ SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical:
- [ ] 50K+ training examples integrated
- [ ] LoRA + dataset training pipeline working
- [ ] Memory usage under 20GB for 2.7B model
- [ ] Training efficiency maintained

### Project:
- [ ] Professional data pipeline established
- [ ] Ready for SOTA benchmarking
- [ ] Foundation for 3B model scaling

## ðŸ’¡ KEY INSIGHT
**We can achieve 90% of Phase 4 goals with accessible datasets**
while continuing LVD-2M research in parallel.

**Phase 4.2 Focus: Build the professional pipeline NOW!** ðŸš€
