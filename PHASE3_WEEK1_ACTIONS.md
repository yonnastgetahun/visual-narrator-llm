# ðŸ“… PHASE 3 - WEEK 1 ACTION PLAN

## MONDAY-TUESDAY: CLOUD DECISION & SETUP

### âœ… Completed:
- [x] Infrastructure assessment
- [x] Phase 3 directory structure
- [x] Cloud strategy planning

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Actions:

**1. Choose Cloud Provider (Today)**
- [ ] Research Lambda Labs vs RunPod
- [ ] Make decision based on ease vs cost
- [ ] Create account

**2. Initial Cloud Test (Tomorrow)**
- [ ] Launch smallest GPU instance
- [ ] Test basic PyTorch installation
- [ ] Verify can run simple training script
- [ ] Estimate actual costs

**3. Code Preparation (This Week)**
- [ ] Adapt training scripts for cloud
- [ ] Set up data streaming
- [ ] Implement multi-GPU support
- [ ] Create cost monitoring

## WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY: 1B PILOT PREPARATION

**4. Model Selection**
- [ ] Choose 1B parameter base model
- [ ] Test model loading on cloud
- [ ] Validate memory requirements

**5. Data Pipeline**
- [ ] Start LVD-2M download (or cloud transfer)
- [ ] Create data preprocessing for cloud
- [ ] Set up validation split

**6. Training Script**
- [ ] Create cloud-optimized training script
- [ ] Add progress monitoring
- [ ] Implement checkpointing to cloud storage

## WEEKEND: READINESS REVIEW

**7. Pre-flight Check**
- [ ] Cloud environment tested
- [ ] 1B model ready for training
- [ ] Data pipeline functional
- [ ] Cost monitoring active
- [ ] Success criteria defined

## SUCCESS CRITERIA - END OF WEEK 1
- [ ] Cloud provider chosen and account active
- [ ] Can launch and use GPU instances
- [ ] 1B model training script ready for cloud
- [ ] Data pipeline working
- [ ] Clear budget and timeline established

## ESTIMATED WEEK 1 CLOUD COST: $5-10
(For testing and small experiments)
